Git Branching starategy

# A branch strategy is a plan for how a team uses Git branches to develop, test, and release 
# code in an organized way without breaking the main production branch.

Diffrence between git tech and git pull.

# Fetch---> Download the lates changes from the remote repo 
#---> but does not merge them into your local branch

Git pull.

# Does git fetch + git merge in one step

# Download the latest changes and immediately merge them into your current branch


# "git fetch only downloads changes from remote" 
# while git pull downloads and merges them into your current branch.
----------------------------------------------------------------


what is pull request and branch

# This process is done when there is a need to put 
# a developer’s change into another person’s code branch.

# branch -->. A branch is nothing but a separate version of the code.

20. What is the significance of git push --force-with-lease over git push --force?

The git push --force-with-lease is a more cautious approach to force-pushing changes to 
a remote repository than git push --force because it prevents accidentally overwriting
 changes made by others on the remote repository.

When you use git push --force, you force-push your changes to the remote repository 
regardless of whether others have updated it since your last fetch. This can lead to the 
unintentional loss of other developers' work.

In contrast, git push --force-with-lease is a safer alternative. 
It checks whether the remote branch you are pushing to has been updated by 
others since your last fetch. If the remote branch has been updated, 
the push is rejected, preventing you from overwriting other developers' changes unintentionally.
