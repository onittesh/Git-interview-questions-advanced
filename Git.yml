Git Branching starategy

# A branch strategy is a plan for how a team uses Git branches to develop, test, and release 
# code in an organized way without breaking the main production branch.

Diffrence between git tech and git pull.

# Fetch---> Download the lates changes from the remote repo 
#---> but does not merge them into your local branch

Git pull.

# Does git fetch + git merge in one step

# Download the latest changes and immediately merge them into your current branch


# "git fetch only downloads changes from remote" 
# while git pull downloads and merges them into your current branch.
